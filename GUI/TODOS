        that the user can then use to create a D2L Quiz
    - QuestionID can be used to group all question within one chapter with the same QuestionID
    - Quiz group could be implemented through:
        - just opening all files in a folder?
        - making one big jumbo file?
        - some other combination?
- create in-depth documentation
